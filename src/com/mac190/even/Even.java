/*
Design and code a class Even that has the following properties:
One private member integer that is even at all times, call it even.
-getter for even
-setter, the setter should work in a way that if the input is not even then it's added one
to make it even.
- method String toString() returns the object as a string:
public String toString() {
    //create a string st.
    //add to it any attribute from the object (any value of your variables in the form
    you want it to be displayed)
    //return the string.
 }

 - method public Even add(int n): returns the object Even that is same as this object augmented
 by n.
 public Even add(int n) {
    //create an Even object.
    //set it to even + n.

    //return the object.
}
In a seprate tester class, test your Even class.
