set it to absolute value
4- constructor that accepts two inputs, first for length and second for width
set to absolute value if negative
5- setters getters for length and width
6- toString and equals.
7- method static Rectangle add (int a) that adds a to both length and width
8- method rectangle add (rectangle r) that returns a rectangle that is the sum
of the two rectangles r and this
9- Method to return perimeter
10- method to return area
